# UPDATE:  
JAN 23, 2021

## This is a work in progress...I have a lot of customizations that I wanna clean up and share on here. First things first, I do wanna clarify...I'm no pro at this stuff...I have a ton of experience in data scraping, database engineering, blah blah...but the SeedBox setup was a first time for me. 

## That being said, anything I upload here should be used with caution...just like anything else you grab and use from Github. 

## ..Anything I put up on here is 100% currently working for my SeedBox server...you may or may not have to tweak the configuration/script/etc to get it working properly for your own setup.  It'll take me a week or so to boilerplate these configurations and scripts, so please bare with me.

**I plan on uploading all kinds of various tweaks/scripts/configs/etc...some examples:**

*   Bash script that auto-rotates Google Drive Service Accounts once hitting the max upload (Rclone Mounts)
*   Various nginx conf files, from plex SSL setup to Swizzin Panel custom video background login pages..
*   My optimized Rclone Google Drive mount command flags for zero buffering and fully saturated bandwidth usage for uploading to the cloud drive
*   Various other BASH scripts to do anything from monitor Rclone Upload limit errors, to overall system status checks.
